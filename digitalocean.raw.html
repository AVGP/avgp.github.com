            <img class="floating" src="digitalocean/brick.svg" width="250" height="250" alt="I used modules before it was cool">
            <p>
                Born in 1989 I grew up in northern Germany and, skipping <a href="http://www.lego.com/en-us/duplo">Duplo&reg;</a> building blocks, I fell in love with LEGO&reg; straight away.
                I was the type of child that would get extremely frustrated with manual tinkering or drawing, as the result never quite turned out to be what I had in my mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                These building blocks on the other side gave me a quick way to get predictable results. Of course there were (still the case, but I'm <em>totally</em> no longer playing with LEGO&reg;)
                constraints in terms of what you could do and what building blocks you had available, but that was fine and I found it challenging, interesting and to foster my
                creativity.
            </p>
            <p>
              This has been the start of an ongoing journey - always looking for bringing the ability to express ideas to as many people as I can and learning new ways to combine or make building blocks myself.

            <p>
                It came the day my attention was drawn to a computer. For me the notion of a "computer" came in the shape of a Commodore 64 of a friend.
                While this thing was by far and long considered deprecated, obsolete hardware in 1998 when I came in contact with it, it was still able to make my eyes shine.
            </p>

            <img class="floating" src="digitalocean/computer.svg" width="250" height="250" alt="The Computer. My way of expressing thoughts">

            <p>
                The reason for that was BASIC. For methen, this was a revelation!
                It was basically an infinite pool of building blocks that I could build much more engaging things with.
                And from here on, things accelerated quickly.
            </p>

            <p>
                Right after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expo_2000">World EXPO came close to my hometown, Hannover</a> I got my first PC.
                It was <a href="http://images.tecchannel.de/images/tecchannel/bdb/326391/890.jpg">this powerful machine</a> (667 MHz, 128MB RAM) and felt like I could do <strong>anything</strong>!
            </p>
            <p>
                After having played all sorts of games for far longer than one should and getting told off quite a few times by my mother for doing so,
                I discovered a CD-ROM that had a Basic Dialect ("Blitzbasic") on it.
            </p>
            <p>No need to say that I started my luck with figuring out how to build my own games with it.</p>

            <h2>The digital frontier</h2>
            <p>
                I also realised, while being a bit late with getting access to a computer, compared to most others in my school,
                I was very privileged and extremely grateful for that. A lot of my friends could not afford to have a computer at all.
                This would play an important role for me from now on.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2002, I finally could convince my parents to switch our <em>very, very</em> old telephone line to one that supported dial up internet connections.
                And this was another groundbreaking moment in my life:
            </p>

            <img class="floating" src="digitalocean/internet.svg" width="250" height="250" alt="The internet; more than just a series of tubes and kittens to me">

            <p>
                Not only did I suddenly have access to insanely large amounts of information but, more importantly, I could get in touch with other people.
                No matter where they were (sorta, but from my perspective back then <em>the whole world</em> was within reach to me when I was online.
                I was reading forums, mailing lists and got hooked on IRC - so many different people, perspectives, aproaches. This was incredible!
            </p>
            <p>
                I then figured out quite quickly, that the web wasn't a medium like TV or Radio.
                Instead, I could bend and twist things and create my own content quite easily - this was also when I discovered Javascript.
            </p>

            <p>
                Unfortunately, back in 2004 getting even a small piece of shared web hosting required to send signed letters and wait for days to get the login credentials back
                before one was able to get anything done.

          <p>
            For me, the transition to a virtual server was a big step forward and it surprisingly only took a day to get one up and running, giving you much more flexibility
            and freedom to tinker with a wide variety of things.
          </p>

          <p>
            I got obsessed with what nowadays would be called "DevOps": Me, primarily developing software (now also part-time after school), maintaining, securing and running
            the infrastructure. I did the same on my job, as it was the most natural way for me: I <em>obviously</em> have to take care about the environment that I'm running
            my code in, right?
          </p>
          <img class="floating" src="digitalocean/devops.svg" width="250" height="250" alt="Developers and Ops united">
          <p>
              Fast forward again to 2012.
              Meanwhile I was working for what was a Startup Incubator at the time (later transformed into a financial product company).
              We had to find ways to dynamically allocate computing infrastructure and storage for a variety of projects with different
              requirements, but one shared, crucial requirement was data safety.
              So we had our own hardware in a high-security datacenter in Switzerland and run Cloudstack on top of that.
          </p>
          <p>
              This made another problem apparent: You need to install all sorts of software on these machines and make sure that each
              required service is running smoothly and gets updated when needed.<br>
              This was when I started working with Vagrant and Puppet.
          </p>
          <p>
              Now I had a viable solution for this particular, constrained environment.
              But what about all my small side projects? The workshops I was giving at the time?
              AWS was fine, but I needed something more simple, quicker, that focussed on me as
              a developer, who's primarily concerned about running code, not administering Policies and
              shift large amounts of data around?
          </p>
          <p>
              That's when I clicked on a Facebook Ad that promised, in a fun small video, to be exactly that.
              <strong>Yes, that was Digital Ocean!</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
              Since then, Digital Ocean is the place to go and spin up droplets when I quickly need to tinker with something.
              Most recent example: I wondered if the distribution of HTTP vs HTTPS shows some geographical patterns that could
              be related to something else (like pricing, internet speed available at the location, etc.).
              So I decided to spin up a DO instance and "survey" the entire internet with the help of some IT Security friends of mine.
          </p>
          <p>
              That ended up creating 13 Gigabytes of JSON, stored in a MongoDB on a droplet in Digital Ocean.
              I still didn't come around processing this data, enriching it with geographical information and mapping it out, but that's next up!

                When I got aware of your opening for a Developer Evangelist position, it immediately caught my attention.
                I love to meet fellow developers to exchange ideas and hear about their problems and pain points and help
                them overcome those.
                I speak at conferences quite a bit and give workshops on various topics. I'm not a specialised expert, but a
                "T-shaped" employee with some focus areas (Deployment, QA &amp; testing, Web Development), but eager and able
                to quickly dive into a new topic and apply the new knowledge to solve problems of all sorts.
            </p>
            <p>
                I would really love to be part of your team and help others leverage the powers you provide them with.
