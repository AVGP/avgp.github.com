I was the type of child that would get extremely frustrated with manual tinkering or drawing, as the result never quite turned out to be what I had in my mind. </p><p>These building blocks on the other side gave me a quick way to get predictable results. Of course there were (still the case, but I'm <em>totally</em> no longer playing with LEGO&reg;) constraints in terms of what you could do and what building blocks you had available, but that was fine and I found it challenging, interesting and to foster my creativity. </p><p>This has been the start of an ongoing journey - always looking for bringing the ability to express ideas to as many people as I can and learning new ways to combine or make building blocks myself. </p></section><section id="to-infinity-and-beyond"><h2>To infinity and beyond</h2><p>It came the day my attention was drawn to a computer. For me the notion of a "computer" came in the shape of a Commodore 64 of a friend. While this thing was by far and long considered deprecated, obsolete hardware in 1998 when I came in contact with it, it was still able to make my eyes shine. </p><img class="floating" src="digitalocean/computer.svg" width="250" height="250" alt="The Computer. My way of expressing thoughts"><p>The reason for that was BASIC. For methen, this was a revelation! It was basically an infinite pool of building blocks that I could build much more engaging things with. And from here on, things accelerated quickly. </p><p>Right after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expo_2000">World EXPO came close to my hometown, Hannover</a> I got my first PC. It was <a href="http://images.tecchannel.de/images/tecchannel/bdb/326391/890.jpg">this powerful machine</a> (667 MHz, 128MB RAM) and felt like I could do <strong>anything</strong>! </p><p>After having played all sorts of games for far longer than one should and getting told off quite a few times by my mother for doing so, I discovered a CD-ROM that had a Basic Dialect ("Blitzbasic") on it. </p><p>No need to say that I started my luck with figuring out how to build my own games with it.</p></section><section id="the-digital-frontier"><h2>The digital frontier</h2><p>I also realised, while being a bit late with getting access to a computer, compared to most others in my school, I was very privileged and extremely grateful for that. A lot of my friends could not afford to have a computer at all. This would play an important role for me from now on. </p><p>In 2002, I finally could convince my parents to switch our <em>very, very</em> old telephone line to one that supported dial up internet connections. And this was another groundbreaking moment in my life: </p><img class="floating" src="digitalocean/internet.svg" width="250" height="250" alt="The internet; more than just a series of tubes and kittens to me"><p>Not only did I suddenly have access to insanely large amounts of information but, more importantly, I could get in touch with other people. No matter where they were (sorta, but from my perspective back then <em>the whole world</em> was within reach to me when I was online. I was reading forums, mailing lists and got hooked on IRC - so many different people, perspectives, aproaches. This was incredible! </p><p>I then figured out quite quickly, that the web wasn't a medium like TV or Radio. Instead, I could bend and twist things and create my own content quite easily - this was also when I discovered Javascript. </p><p>Unfortunately, back in 2004 getting even a small piece of shared web hosting required to send signed letters and wait for days to get the login credentials back before one was able to get anything done. </p></section><section id="the-rise-of-devops"><h2>The rise of DevOps</h2><p>For me, the transition to a virtual server was a big step forward and it surprisingly only took a day to get one up and running, giving you much more flexibility and freedom to tinker with a wide variety of things. </p><p>I got obsessed with what nowadays would be called "DevOps": Me, primarily developing software (now also part-time after school), maintaining, securing and running the infrastructure. I did the same on my job, as it was the most natural way for me: I <em>obviously</em> have to take care about the environment that I'm running my code in, right? </p><img class="floating" src="digitalocean/devops.svg" width="250" height="250" alt="Developers and Ops united"><p>Fast forward again to 2012. Meanwhile I was working for what was a Startup Incubator at the time (later transformed into a financial product company). We had to find ways to dynamically allocate computing infrastructure and storage for a variety of projects with different requirements, but one shared, crucial requirement was data safety. So we had our own hardware in a high-security datacenter in Switzerland and run Cloudstack on top of that. </p><p>This made another problem apparent: You need to install all sorts of software on these machines and make sure that each required service is running smoothly and gets updated when needed.<br> This was when I started working with Vagrant and Puppet. </p><p>Now I had a viable solution for this particular, constrained environment. But what about all my small side projects? The workshops I was giving at the time? AWS was fine, but I needed something more simple, quicker, that focussed on me as a developer, who's primarily concerned about running code, not administering Policies and shift large amounts of data around? </p><p>That's when I clicked on a Facebook Ad that promised, in a fun small video, to be exactly that. <strong>Yes, that was Digital Ocean!</strong></p><p>Since then, Digital Ocean is the place to go and spin up droplets when I quickly need to tinker with something. Most recent example: I wondered if the distribution of HTTP vs HTTPS shows some geographical patterns that could be related to something else (like pricing, internet speed available at the location, etc.). So I decided to spin up a DO instance and "survey" the entire internet with the help of some IT Security friends of mine. </p><p>That ended up creating 13 Gigabytes of JSON, stored in a MongoDB on a droplet in Digital Ocean. I still didn't come around processing this data, enriching it with geographical information and mapping it out, but that's next up! </p><section id="lets-talk"><h2>Let's talk!</h2><p>When I got aware of your opening for a Developer Evangelist position, it immediately caught my attention. I love to meet fellow developers to exchange ideas and hear about their problems and pain points and help them overcome those. I speak at conferences quite a bit and give workshops on various topics. I'm not a specialised expert, but a "T-shaped" employee with some focus areas (Deployment, QA &amp; testing, Web Development), but eager and able to quickly dive into a new topic and apply the new knowledge to solve problems of all sorts. </p><p>I would really love to be part of your team and help others leverage the powers you provide them with. Please drop me an email or a tweet and let's have a chat! </p></section></section><nav class="mobile" id="menu"><ul><li><a href="#home">Home</a></li><li><a href="#tldr">TL;DR</a></li><li><a href="#prologue">Prologue</a></li><li><a href="#to-infinity-and-beyond">To Infinity &amp; beyond</a></li><li><a href="#the-digital-frontier">The digital frontier</a></li><li><a href="#the-rise-of-devops">The rise of DevOps</a></li><li><a href="#lets-talk">Let's talk!</a></li></ul></nav></article><script>!function(){"use strict";function e(e,t,n){e.addEventListener?e.addEventListener(t,n,!1):e.attachEvent&&e.attachEvent("on"+t,n)}function t(e){return window.localStorage&&localStorage.font_css_cache&&localStorage.font_css_cache_file===e}function n(){if(window.localStorage&&window.XMLHttpRequest)if(t(o))c(localStorage.font_css_cache);else{var n=new XMLHttpRequest;n.open("GET",o,!0),e(n,"load",function(){4===n.readyState&&(c(n.responseText),localStorage.font_css_cache=n.responseText,localStorage.font_css_cache_file=o)}),n.send()}else{var a=document.createElement("link");a.href=o,a.rel="stylesheet",a.type="text/css",document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(a),document.cookie="font_css_cache"}}function c(e){var t=document.createElement("style");t.innerHTML=e,document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(t)}var o="/digitalocean/font.css";window.localStorage&&localStorage.font_css_cache||document.cookie.indexOf("font_css_cache")>-1?n():e(window,"load",n)}()</script></body></html>
