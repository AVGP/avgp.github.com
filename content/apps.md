# Apps

Some of the apps I built:

## TakeMeTo

Swiss public transport - quick &amp; easy.
Using [public transport data from OpenData.ch](http://transport.opendata.ch/) it allows to quickly find stations nearby or get connections starting from a nearby station.
In addition to the normal "from" / "to" connection search it also features connection and station bookmarks, so connections can be looked up offline.
