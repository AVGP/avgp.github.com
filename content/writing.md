# Writing
Besides [blogging](http://50linesofco.de) I write articles for various publications from time to time and I am currently in the early stages of writing [an ebook on web components](http://www.leanpub.com/webcomponents).

I am in the process of writing [a book on Polymer](https://www.dpunkt.de/buecher/12286/9783864903861-web-components-mit-polymer.html) for d.punkt publishing.

Here is a list of articles I wrote so far:
