## Omni - a multi dialog interface experiment with web components and different input methods
The Metro interface tried to accomodate touch input and keyboard/mouse input in one interface.

So I wondered: What about creating an [MDI](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_Document_Interface)-ish interface
that turns into a touch-friendly interface when used on smaller screen estates.

And that's what's Omni about - [take a look here](http://avgp.github.io/Omni) or [peek at the source](https://github.com/avgp/Omni).


## Open data visualisation with D3.js
Using some open data on energy production for Germany and Switzerland, I had a go at D3.js.

[The swiss energy production](http://avgp.github.io/opendata-playground/energy_production/switzerland/index.html)
and the [german energy production](https://github.com/AVGP/opendata-playground/tree/master/energy_production) can be visualized over time - [the source is available on Github, of course].
