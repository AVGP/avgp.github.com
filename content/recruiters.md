# Recruiters

Hey $firstname,

first things first: Thanks for sending me that email! I feel valued and appreciated - it's an honour to be considered for $opportunity...

Right, without further ado: If you clicked this link, only the first stage of your recruiting is automated
or you have the unfortunate talent to come across like an automated email when you're crafting yours.

Nonetheless, I'm super excited to be in touch with you, it's just that there's so much traffic that I gotta make sure I only get quality offers
from recruiters who are really interested in me.

## Proceeding to round 2

Now you probably asked me to send you my CV or otherwise get back in touch with you regarding the opportunity - and that's cool!
But as I said: I need to see you *really* mean it, so I am charging a handling fee of 500 CHF (approx. 500 EUR / $520 / £400).

You can pay quickly and comfortably using this convenient link:

<div style="font-size: 2em; text-align: center;">
  <a href="https://paypal.me/webzuerich">paypal.me/webzuerich</a>
</div>

Once that has happened, I'm happy to talk :-)

Cheers,
Martin
