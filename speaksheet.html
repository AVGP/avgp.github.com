  <h1 id="speaksheet">Speaksheet</h1>
<h2 id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h2>
<ul>
<li>I&#39;m happy to give a unique talk that fits your event and the audience - but in return I must ask for covering my costs for getting to your event and staying there as long as needed.</li>
<li>So give me a flight and a place to crash at (your sofa is probably fine, hotel is also fine - whatever your budget allows) and we&#39;re likely going to have a match here!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="want-me-as-a-speaker-on-your-conference-">Want me as a speaker on your conference?</h2>
<p>Thanks, that&#39;s nice!<br>Please tell me what you&#39;d like me to talk about and the audience I will be talking to (average age, casual or business, designers/developers/PMs/etc) and what your conference is about.</p>
<h3 id="what-you-ll-get">What you&#39;ll get</h3>
<p>A prepared, rehearsed talk that addresses your audience and the characteristics of your conference.<br>You also get to pick the topic - even if I gave the talk before, I will <em>always</em> adapt it to your conference and audience.</p>
<p>I make sure I&#39;m prepared and ready for the talk and that I&#39;m available to the other attendees for questions and chit-chat before and after the talk.</p>
<p>Also please note that I&#39;d need you to do some things for me:</p>
<h3 id="travel-accomodation">Travel &amp; Accomodation</h3>
<p>Please cover my travel and accomodation expenses - it doesn&#39;t need to be a business class flight or a shiny hotel (gimme a room with a bed and we&#39;re cool), though.</p>
<p>I&#39;m investing time and energy to prep a nice, individual talk for your audience - that takes time and I&#39;d like to focus on that rather than planning and handling my expenses.<br>If you can&#39;t cover my travel and accomodation, let&#39;s talk right upfront about it.</p>
<p>On the topic of speaker expenses, I highly recommend reading <a href="http://pewpewlaser.com/blogs/647">this article</a> that explains why this is important to me and many others.</p>
<h3 id="have-a-solid-stage-setup">Have a solid stage setup</h3>
<p>I&#39;ll bring my own laptop and presenter.</p>
<p>But please tell me what video connector I can expect, have a reasonable beamer with enough contrast and provide a microphone. Have your setup tested before I jump on stage.<br>Recording the audio and video is a plus, but not required.<br>If you do it, I&#39;m fine with it.</p>
<h3 id="get-me-">Get me!</h3>
<p>If that&#39;s all alright with you, drop me a message <a href="https://twitter.com/g33konaut">on twitter</a>.</p>
